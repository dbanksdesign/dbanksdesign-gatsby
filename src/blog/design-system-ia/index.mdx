## Introduction

I like learning from others and seeing unique perspectives. In my career I have taken a lot of inspiration and learned a lot from public design systems. I wanted to share what I have synthesized from admiring the amazing work companies and individuals have done. I have compiled some data on the information architecture of a sampling of public design systems. In this article I will show some general data like what terms are most common, as well as some call outs to specific examples I think are informative. As is customary, some disclaimers:

1. Don't take any of these examples or data as what you *should* do for your organization. Every team, organization, and company are different and have different needs. 
2. I tried my best to normalize the data. I used what I saw as the main navigations of the design system websites. This might not include things like other links on their homepages.
3. I tried my best to include as many public design systems as possible, but I am human so there might be some omissions. If yours is not on here and you think it should, my website is available on Github, you can open a pull request! Or just DM me on twitter, that is a bit easier.


Primary navigation items being clickable. If the design system website uses a side navigation bar, the primary navigation can either be in the form of section headers, expanders, or actual clickable targets that navigate to a page. Some sites like Thumbprint have the primary navigation items clickable, but navigate to the first secondary page in that section.

## Top Level Stats

<KPI value="6.3" label="Avg. top level nav items" />

<KPI value="61" label="Design systems" />

<TopLevelCount />

## Most common top level nav items

<Counts />

### Getting Started... or not

<Breakdown data={[{label:'Getting Started', value:19},{label:'Get Started', value:5}]} />

### Search

<Breakdown data={[{label:'With search', value:36}, {label:'Without search', value:25}]} />

### Navigation Position

<Breakdown data={[{label:'Top', value:23}, {label:'Side', value:38}]} />

## Layout

There are 2 main layouts design system sites take: top navigation and side navigation.

Including an overview page for each top-level navigation item.

One design system I did not include is the one I've worked on at Amazon. This is because it is not public, but if you find me in person I might show it to you. That does not mean I can't tell you the information architecture I used. This is what I believe is working for my use-case so take what you will.
