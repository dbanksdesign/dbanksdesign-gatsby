For most of my career I have been on teams that would be thought of as "underfunded" for design. The ratio of designers to developers or product managers always seemed low, or at least that is what I've always been told.

It seems like a good amount of the time any given team is "underfunded" for design resources, and the default is to become defeatist and say your organization, team, or company does not value design. If they did, there would be a good ratio of designers to developers and product managers, right? Maybe, but instead of complaining about head counts, why not scale yourself and what you have first?

Design is everyone's job. Design is not some special thing that only designers can do. Sarah Federman summed it up quite nicely in this tweet:

If your first instinct to scale design is to hire more designers, you are potentially missing out on some untapped resources. A designer's job isn't to "do" all the "designing", but rather, empower the team around them to make better decisions on behalf of their customers. Having all "design decisions" made by a "designer" creates artificial barriers of ownership. I would much rather teach and empower others to make those design decisions rather than have a bottleneck and single-point-of-failure on myself. 

It is my goal to make myself obsolete. If the team I'm on is making the best decisions for our customers, then my job is done, or at least I can move on to other areas. If I can get my developers and product managers in a place where they are able to make good design judgements on their own, then I've already paid for myself haven't I?

### The Thanos test

This is going to sound super morbid, but this concept has really made me a better designer/developer/teammate. If you and your team were dusted in the [Thanos Snapâ„¢](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZmtb8eDDNs), or rather just quit the company, would a similar team be able to carry on your team's charter in a way that would make you proud? If the answer is anything other than "yes", you have work to do. 

The reason this is important is having these silos of tribal knowledge does not empower others to do their jobs well. It forces them to talk to you or your team to find out how to do something. I want to have all of my experience and knowledge in a way for anyone in the team or company to be able to use. That empowers them and reduces the dependency on me. 

### Senior salary

I was talking to a coworker recently and he told me a great story about the salaries of senior and principle designers and developers. Imagine a principle developer's salary is 5x that of a normal developer, how do you rationalize that cost? Is the principle developer expected to do 5x the coding of a normal developer? Certainly not. Instead, if the principle developer was on a team of 20 other developers, and they made the other developers 25% more productive through guidance and empowering others, their 5x salary would equal the productivity benefit (20 * 0.25 = 5).

As designers it is our job to be productivity multipliers. This is where scaling comes in again. Sure you could hire more designers, just like in the hypothetical scenario above that team could hire 5 more developers sure, but there are untapped resources already by empowering others. 

### "I don't know"

This phrase has been liberating. It has helped build trust and transparency across disciplines by being honest. Developers or Product Managers will look to me for a solution to a problem, and a good amount of the time my answer is "I don't know". It could seem like I am a "bad" designer for not knowing how to solve every problem on the spot, but being honest with my teammates about 

Asking developers or product managers what they think the solution to a design problem should be helps build shared ownership. Even if you, as a designer, do not agree, you can use it as a teachable moment so they can learn and make more informed decisions in the future. Having all "design decisions" made by a "designer" creates artificial barriers of ownership. 


### Being vocally self-critical

This is one of [Amazon's leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles), and one that I think is important when trying to lead teams.
