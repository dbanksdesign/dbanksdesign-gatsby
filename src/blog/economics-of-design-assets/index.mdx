I came across a tweet a little while ago that sparked something inside me. 

I like economics, specifically behavioral economics, why we make the decisions that we do. 

In simplistic economics you can measure things like sales, output, utility, efficiency. Imagine a firm that produces widgets, it has a factory and workers. Each worker is paid $15 an hour and on average produce 1 widget per hour. Let's say the cost of the materials to make a widget are $5, making the total cost of goods $20. You sell widgets for $40. 

What does all this have to do with design and design artifacts? What is the *utility* of a design artifact like a mockup or prototype? As with most things, it depends. If you are only using it to convey to developers what to build, the utility is in its ability to 

1. Affect the *actual* interface experienced by the user
1. Make development of that interface more efficient

The user never sees a Sketch file or Invision prototype. 

Design systems make designers and developers more efficient through reusable components, layouts, and patterns. 

There are other potential utilities in design artifacts such as for usability testing and stakeholder sign-off. 

Let's take a look at an example. Imagine you are designing a feature and you plan on using only components and layouts defined in the design system, everyone is happy. You build mockups in Sketch or Figma and built a few flows to hand off to a developer. Maybe it took you a day. That day you spent on that is a cost; your time is valuable. The developer builds the feature in a week and launches it. The system works. Sort of. If you could make a change to the process to cut 50% of the design and development time with no difference to what the user sees, that is free money (or time). 

Does this mean designers or the design process is unnecessary? Absolutely not. Instead, think about the utility of your work. If you can use a hand-drawn wireframe, write a simple document, or pair program with a developer that will save you both a significant amount of time rather than creating costly process artifacts

Does this mean we should never use Sketch or other UI design/prototyping tools? No, but we should be conscious of the return on investment of the artifacts we are creating in the project lifecycle.

Dan Eden talked about this in his presentation at Clarity this year called, Where we can go. There was one slide in particular that resonated with me.

At Amazon I work on the applications sellers use to manage their business on Amazon. At some point our team was tracking session length as a success metric. If sellers are using the mobile app for longer, that must be a good thing right? Well, if they are staying the app longer, but not accomplishing anything, then we are wasting their precious time. What we really cared about is the actions sellers took and inversely that it took them less time to do it. If they can perform the same actions in less time then that is more time they can be doing other things. 

The same applies to the design process. The less time designers spend "designing", the more time they can spend doing other things.
